Josh Jotting:

Grimoire did most of the heavy lifting here but it definitely helped knowing foundations of programming languages because, though I didn’t have much experience with javascript, css, or HTML (which i needed for this small day project) I was able to fix small problems in formatting like getting black borders between the shapes. The project didn’t have too many problems, though I spent about an hour trying to troubleshoot an intermittent issue that caused some shapes to be T or L shaped within the generateGrid() function.

I quite like the mondrian art style and I enjoyed the opportunity to try to tackle a problem by utilizing AI, though it was nowhere near as difficult as the project of spray painting my car which I undertook in June of 2022. 

Here are some photos of the Mondrian car, Wanda:
